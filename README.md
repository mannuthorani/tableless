## Instructor: [Manish Kumar (MK)][instructor url]


ActiveRecord comes with a powerful set of validators and other features for attributes of a persisted data model. On other hand Forms are one of the oldest and most important building blocks of today’s web applications – An essential interface for user input. From the two form helpers that Rails provides, "form_for" also assumes that you’re working with some kind of persisted object. So it can take full benefit of all active record features. i.e validations.

This is all great for persisted objects with database-backed representations. But what happens when you need a complex form that does not reflect a persistent record of some sort?

Hi, my name is Manish Kumar and in this tutorial I'll be talking about the possible solutions for this problem and how to implement one in Rails 4 (Active Models).
